                <h4>Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</h4>
                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Daniel Goleman</p>
                <p><strong>First Published:</strong> 1995</p>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> In this groundbreaking book, Daniel Goleman explores the concept of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and argues that it plays a crucial role in personal and professional success, often more so than traditional IQ. He identifies five key components of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills, which collectively influence our ability to navigate social complexities, make decisions, and manage our own emotions effectively.</p>
